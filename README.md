## Introduction

The maze solver application allows users to interactively create mazes, choose from search algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and A*, and visualize the process of finding the optimal path from a start to an end point in the maze.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive maze creation and algorithm selection.
- Visualization of the maze-solving process using various search algorithms.
- Support for different maze configurations and sizes.
- Adjustable speed for visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pygame library

You can install pygame using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malik2905/maze-solver.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd maze-solver
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the GUI.py file to start the application:

```bash
python GUI.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to create mazes, choose search algorithms, and visualize the maze-solving process.

## Algorithms

The application supports the following search algorithms:

- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)
- A* Search Algorithm

## Mazes

Several pre-configured mazes are available in the 'maze' folder.
